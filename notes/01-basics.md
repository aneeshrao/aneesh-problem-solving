## 1. What is a Factor?

A factor of a number is an integer that divides the number evenly, leaving no remainder. 
For example, 

a. The factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6 because:
- 6 รท 1 = 6 (remainder 0)
- 6 รท 2 = 3 (remainder 0)
- 6 รท 3 = 2 (remainder 0)
- 6 รท 6 = 1 (remainder 0)

b. The factors of 100 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, and 100 because:
- 100 รท 1 = 100 (remainder 0)
- 100 รท 2 = 50 (remainder 0)
- 100 รท 4 = 25 (remainder 0)
- 100 รท 5 = 20 (remainder 0)
- 100 รท 10 = 10 (remainder 0)
- 100 รท 20 = 5 (remainder 0)
- 100 รท 25 = 4 (remainder 0)
- 100 รท 50 = 2 (remainder 0)
- 100 รท 100 = 1 (remainder 0)
