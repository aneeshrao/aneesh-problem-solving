## 1. What is an Array?

An array is a data structure that can hold a fixed number of values of the same type.  
It is a collection of elements identified by index or key.

### Characteristics of Arrays:
- **Fixed Size:** The size of an array is defined at the time of its creation and cannot be changed.
- **Homogeneous Elements:** All elements in an array are of the same data type (e.g., integers, strings).
- **Indexed Access:** Each element in the array can be accessed using its index, which typically starts from 0.

### Example of an Array:
```python
# Creating an array of integers
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

# Accessing elements
first_element = numbers[0]  # 10
third_element = numbers[2]  # 30

# Modifying an element
numbers[1] = 25  # Now numbers = [10, 25, 30, 40, 50]
```

## 2. Problems on Arrays

a. Given an array of size N, Reverse the array.
b. Given an array of size N, find the maximum and minimum elements in the array.
c. Given an array of size N, Reverse the array for the indices from L to R (both inclusive).
d. Given an array of size N, Rotate the array to the right by K steps.
